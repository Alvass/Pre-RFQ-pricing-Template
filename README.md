**Automated template to prepare RFQ and ensure sales were viable created in 2016** 

## Situation
During my time as a sales consultant working for an Aerospace supply chain service provider, I was responsible to find the best source of supply and price the item competitively to win business from customer who also work with other distributors. 

## Task
My main yearly objectives were sales and margin and in order to ensure those KPIs were taking into consideration when pricing a business, I created a simple automated table where I would only need to fill the grey cells leaving all the calculations to Excel.

## Action
I started to mirror the quote system used in the company, add calculation formulas, the ability to enter a currency other than GBP which will calculate the Â£ equivalent and the Margin based the pricing strategy I would use. 

## Result
This tool saved me a lot of working time and also enable me to tweak slightly the RFQ to meet customers total budget or a price on a certain item while increasing another to compensate. This was also welcomed by my management who could review the full quote and approved it if I had to go lower than the expected margin.
